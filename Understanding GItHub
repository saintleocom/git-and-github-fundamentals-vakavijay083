Hi Everyone,

First of all, it is a great pleasure meeting you all.
I have done some exercises on GIT and understood a bit. 
GIT is a tool which is used for Co-Ordinating with one another in any aspect.
If there are two or more developers started coding in their local environment It will be difficult task to combine all their work.
So, we have GIT in hand for rescue.ðŸ˜„ 
We can clone the entire project, make some changes and you can push your code.
Now a days, we are using emoji everywhere, so in Git also we We can use emoji.
Finally, if we use Git then we can do our work easily and also team effort can be more efficient.

Thank you,
Vijay Bhaskar Reddy Vaka.
